# 🌍 Terraform: Zero to Advanced — My Hands-on Journey

Welcome to my Terraform learning repository! This project is a hands-on collection of `.tf` files and examples I created from scratch to learn Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**.

Each folder in this repo demonstrates a specific concept — starting from the basics and progressing into real-world use cases using AWS.
