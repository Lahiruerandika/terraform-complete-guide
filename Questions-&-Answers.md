# Question 1

**The terraform.tfstate file always matches your currently built infrastructure.**

- A. True  
- B. False âœ…

---

## âœ… Correct Answer: B. False

### ðŸ“Œ Explanation:
The `terraform.tfstate` file **does not always reflect the actual infrastructure state**.  
It represents Terraform's **last known state**, based on what Terraform has created or modified.

If someone makes **manual changes** to infrastructure outside of Terraform (like in a cloud console), the state file wonâ€™t be updated unless you run:

```bash
terraform refresh
