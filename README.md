Welcome to my **Terraform learning journey**!  
This repository contains all the `.tf` files, use cases, and notes I created while learning Terraform — starting from absolute basics to advanced infrastructure automation.

## 📚 About This Repository

This repo is designed as a hands-on guide to mastering Terraform through practical examples. It includes:

- ✅ Basic configuration and workflow (`init`, `plan`, `apply`)
- 📦 Variables, outputs, and data sources
- 🧱 Modules and reusable code
- 🔁 Loops, conditionals, meta-arguments
- ☁️ AWS infrastructure examples (VPCs, EC2, S3, etc.)
- 📦 Remote state management and backends
- 🌍 Terraform Cloud and workspaces
- 🛠 Real-world infrastructure setups

All files and configurations were created by me from scratch to reinforce and demonstrate key Terraform concepts.
